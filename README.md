# Butterfingers


Hello guys ,
Butterfingers is made with mediapipe,opencv,pyautogui packages.

Let me quickly give the descryption of this project:

Using opencv video is analysed frame by frame and using mediapipe got the landmarks of the hand .
from the landmarks i used the coordinates of tips of index,ring,middle,thumb fingers and then I used basic math like finding the distance between the points
if the distance between the thumb and index tips is less than 30 pixels then it implements scroll down by pyautogui...
similarly if distance between thumb and middle is less than 30 pix then scolls up
if distance between thumb and ring finger is less than 30 pix it implements double click
## Note:: please place your cursor in the center of the screen and show your fingers clearly to the cam.
## make sure you have the latest versions of the packages 
## if u dont have them then run this in your terminal,(pip install opencv,mediapipe,pyautogui)

Guys there are a lot of functions in these packages, all you have to do is know the logic, know the functions you need and code the way you want....


if you are really excited to learn these stuff ....dm me i will guide you!
